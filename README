Main requirements: qiskit, tkinter
The tkinter library is most likely already installed with python.

This is a simulation of Quantum 6 Nimmt! The user controls all the players
within the game simulation.

The confirm button is used to send discards and go to the next player's view.
Once every player's discard has been discarded, the turn proceeds as normal.
